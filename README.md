# Learn OpenGL with Rust

Going through [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) with Rust. This repo contains my progress working through examples and exercises
from each chapter. A verbalized summary of my learnings containing concept and code explanations can be found in the [summaries](/summaries)
directory but they are not guaranteed to be correct as they are reflections of my understanding of some topic at that time.

## Why Rust?

I'm an amateur at C++ at best and would consider myself an expert with Rust. I don't mind having to write `unsafe` Rust since this is for
learning purposes.

## Why OpenGL?

It seems like the friendliest API to get your feet wet into graphics programming. I have a little bit of experience of OpenGL in the past
but I didn't manage to work with them consistently enough for them to stick, so here I am starting again from scratch.

Graphics programming isn't something that I plan to get into career-wise, so it's not crucial that I learn the most modern graphics APIs, however my ultimate
goal is to eventually become able to wrangle [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/) with the graphics knowledge I will acquire from this endeavor.
